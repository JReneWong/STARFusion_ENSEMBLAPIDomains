Notes: This module was executed using 1 thread with 70 Gb of RAM (This will depend on the size of your BAM file and jobs). We used Singularity to execute STAR-Fusion, as described in the GitHub from the software (https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion/wiki/Home/9b7b28b6028c5fcdf8c245a3c7b84abdbee7ebdc). The /bin directory will require the .simg file from Singularity, please follow the instructions in their GitHub to download it. User can easily modfy the /bin/mkfile.sh file to execute STAR-Fusion.
